## 📊 Track Your Progress

### Grade Calculator
Keep your assignment tracker updated to calculate your current grade:

```
Current Grade = (0.30 × Exam Avg) + (0.15 × Final) +
                (0.20 × HW Avg) + (0.25 × Lab Avg) +
                (0.10 × Quiz Avg)
```

### Goals
- **Week 3:** First lab report A/B (1/3 toward exemption)
- **Week 5:** Second consecutive A/B (2/3)
- **Week 7:** Third consecutive A/B = **Exemption achieved!**
- **Exam 1:** Target ≥85%
- **Exam 2:** Target ≥85%
- **Exam 3:** Target ≥85%
- **Final:** Strong finish!
