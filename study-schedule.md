## Study Techniques

### Active Learning
1. **Don't just read** - work problems
2. **Teach concepts** to someone else (or yourself)
3. **Draw diagrams** - circuits, Bode plots, block diagrams
4. **Use MATLAB** - verify your hand calculations

### Formula Sheet Strategy
- **Don't cram** everything - you won't find it
- **Include:**
  - Key formulas (time constants, Laplace pairs)
  - Your most common mistakes
  - Worked examples
  - Quick reference tables
- **Organize** by topic with clear headers

### Practice Problems
- **Do homework again** without looking at answers
- **Time yourself** - practice under exam conditions
- **Check your work** - learn from mistakes
- **Understand concepts** - don't just memorize

### Group Study
- **Form study group** - explain concepts to each other
- **Compare notes** - fill gaps in understanding
- **Work problems together** - then independently
- **Quiz each other** - test comprehension

## During the Exam

### Time Management
1. **Scan entire exam first** (2 min)
2. **Do easy problems first** to build confidence
3. **Mark difficult problems** to return to
4. **Allocate time** - don't spend 20 min on one problem
5. **Save 10 minutes** to check answers

### Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Read carefully** - what is being asked?
2. **Draw diagram** if applicable
3. **Write known values** and what you need to find
4. **Show all work** - partial credit possible
5. **Check units** throughout
6. **Verify answer** - does it make sense?

### Common Exam Mistakes
- ❌ Not reading problem fully
- ❌ Arithmetic errors (use calculator!)
- ❌ Wrong units or forgetting units
- ❌ Sign errors
- ❌ Rushing and making careless mistakes
- ❌ Leaving problems blank

**If stuck:**
- Move on and come back
- Try a different approach
- Check formula sheet
- Make educated guess if needed

---

## After the Exam

### Immediate
- Don't discuss answers with classmates (causes anxiety)
- Review what went well and what didn't
- Note topics that were challenging

### When Graded
- **Review your mistakes** carefully
- **Understand corrections** - don't just look at points
- **Ask questions** in office hours
- **Keep for final exam** study

---

## Office Hours Strategy

### Before Going
- Try problems yourself first
- Bring specific questions
- Bring your work (show what you tried)
- Be ready to explain your thinking

### Questions to Ask
- "I tried this approach... where did I go wrong?"
- "Can you explain this concept another way?"
- "How do I approach problems like this?"
- NOT: "I don't understand anything, teach me the chapter"

### Best Times
- Early in week (before homework due)
- After getting homework/exam back
- When stuck on specific concept
- Before exams (but not day before!)

## Emergency Study Plan

### If You're Behind
**Triage:**
1. Identify critical gaps (what's on next exam?)
2. Focus on upcoming deadlines first
3. Get help immediately (office hours, TA)
4. Adjust schedule to catch up

**Catch-Up Strategy:**
1. Skim lecture notes for key concepts
2. Do practice problems (even if you check answers)
3. Attend every class and lab
4. Form study group for support

### If You Failed an Exam
- **Don't panic** - final exam can replace it if you have excused absence policy
- **Analyze mistakes** - where did you go wrong?
- **Get help** - office hours ASAP
- **Adjust study strategy** for next exam
- **Remember:** One exam doesn't define you
